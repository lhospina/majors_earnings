# Exploring Earnings Based on College Majors

The current project will focus on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The dataset was collected by the American Community Service, and was cleaned and released by FiveThirtyEight. 

The project includes using common data visualizations in matplotlib to answer basic questions regarding college majors and subsequent salaries after graduation.
